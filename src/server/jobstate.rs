//! Generic JobState handling
//!
//! A 'Job' can have 3 states
//!  - Created, when a schedule was created but never executed
//!  - Started, when a job is running right now
//!  - Finished, when a job was running in the past
//!
//! and is identified by 2 values: jobtype and jobname (e.g. 'syncjob' and 'myfirstsyncjob')
//!
//! This module Provides 2 helper structs to handle those coniditons
//! 'Job' which handles locking and writing to a file
//! 'JobState' which is the actual state
//!
//! an example usage would be
//! ```no_run
//! # use anyhow::{bail, Error};
//! # use proxmox_backup::server::TaskState;
//! # use proxmox_backup::server::jobstate::*;
//! # fn some_code() -> TaskState { TaskState::OK { endtime: 0 } }
//! # fn code() -> Result<(), Error> {
//! // locks the correct file under /var/lib
//! // or fails if someone else holds the lock
//! let mut job = match Job::new("jobtype", "jobname") {
//!     Ok(job) => job,
//!     Err(err) => bail!("could not lock jobstate"),
//! };
//!
//! // job holds the lock, we can start it
//! job.start("someupid")?;
//! // do something
//! let task_state = some_code();
//! job.finish(task_state)?;
//!
//! // release the lock
//! drop(job);
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//!
//! ```
